First, add to very top of Product Page of MAIN product(s) you're selling. Even above the Product Information section.

Now for the main settings:
Add both images. You can use the same for the 2nd (mobile) image, but you must have that 2nd image or it won't display on mobile devices!
Image overlay: 0%
Banner height: Large 
Desktop content position: Middle left
Uncheck "Show container on desktop"
Desktop alignment: left
Color scheme: Chose one with a very light background with dark text. Preferably "Scheme 1"
Image behavior: none
Mobile content alignment: center
Uncheck "Stack images on mobile"
Check "Show container on mobile"
And in the "Theme Settings" section, uncheck "Reveal sections on scroll"

For the blocks, you can remove the Logo images if you want. But if you do, add "padding: 2rem" to this in "assets/mobile.css":
.hero-section-main .banner__buttons

And for Buttons, only use the First button label. Uncheck "use outline button" and use a color scheme that matches your brand.
