Heading size: Large
Make sure the color scheme matches your background
Finally, in the "Heading", BOLD the text. And if you italicize a word, it turns blue! 

You can change that italicized color in assets/powerups.css. Find this line:
.video-section h2.title.inline-richtext em

And change the color to your brand's color.
