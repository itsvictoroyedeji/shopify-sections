Make sure the background is the same as only-image.liquid, because it looks good.

To move the dots, in "sections/hot-spots.liquid" ctrl + f (or command + f) this:
--hot-spot-horizontal-position-desktop

You'll 6 settings for each dot. The first group of settings is for the first dot, the 2nd group is for the 2nd dot, and so on. Adjust the percentages accordingly.
