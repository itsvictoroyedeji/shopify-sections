Name of the section in the Customizer is called "Custom Page Top Banner".

1. For main background image, a Rectangular image is best. These dimensions work best: 2880px width x 1678px height. Make it in Canva.

2. Add your page title. If it your story, click on "Default Page" on top and create a new template called "our story" (Based on "Default page"). Then:

3. CLICK ON "Page" on the left side. Then on the right side, look for "Custom CSS". Then add this code:

h1 {
  display: none;
}

That removes the "Our Story" title from the page (it only appears on the Custom Page Top Banner). Only do this if you're using this Custom Banner.

4. For everything else, make sure you're using the best color scheme for your brand. You may have to create a NEW color scheme that has:
- white text (#FFF)
- Solid button background color that matches your brand
- white solid button label (#FFF)

Finally:

For "background-image" css (locaed in the custom-banner.liquid file), replace the 3 sets of 4 numbers (/0622/8072/8756/ in this example) with your own set of numbers.

 Here's an example:
  
  .section-{{section.id}}-padding {
    background-image: url('https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0622/8072/8756/{{section.settings.background_image}}')
  }

> To find your own set of numbers, go to your Shopify Admin page > Content > Files. Copy the URL from one of your images, then paste it on a new tab in your browser to see the url. You will have your own 3 sets of 4 numbers (which are the same for all images/gifs in your account).

> Replace those 3 sets of 4 numbers after the https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/(your numbers here)/{{section.settings.background_image}}'

This shows up as the background image of your custom banner, which you can change in your Customizer.

 


  Once you're done...you're good to go!
