Name of the section in the Customizer is called "Custom Page Top Banner".

1. For main background image, a Rectangular image is best. These dimensions work best: 2880px width x 1678px height. Make it in Canva.

2. Add your page title. If it your story, click on "Default Page" on top and create a new template called "our story" (Based on "Default page"). Then:

3. CLICK ON "Page" on the left side. Then on the right side, look for "Custom CSS". Then add this code:

h1 {
  display: none;
}

That removes the "Our Story" title from the page (it only appears on the Custom Page Top Banner). Only do this if you're using this Custom Banner.

4. For everything else, make sure you're using the best color scheme for your brand. You may have to create a NEW color scheme that has:
- white text (#FFF)
- Solid button background color that matches your brand
- white solid button label (#FFF)

And you're good to go!
