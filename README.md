# Custom Shopify Sections
### Power-ups to supercharge your sales

I created several custom sections to enhance my Shopify stores. So I decided to keep a codebase here. But you can use it if you want.

## To use

In Shopify, create 4 files: `flickity.css`, `flickity.pkgd.min.js`, `custom.css`, and `mobile.css` under the `Assets` folder in Shopify.

Then copy the codes here (from the same filenames) and paste into Shopify. e.g: `assets/flickty.css`, `assets/flickity.pkgd.min.js`, etc.

## After that...

- To add the liquid files, create a new liquid file in your Shopify code editor under `Sections` using the same name we have here (e.g. `benefits-slider`). Make sure you choose `liquid` as the file type.

- Copy and paste the code in my liquid file to your new liquid file in Shopify (e.g. `sections/benefit-slider.liquid`) 

- Repeat the same steps for the rest of the liquid files you want to add. I'll describe what each liquid file does later on.

(Or you can test it out and find out yourself!)

```
For `video.liquid`, the files are already in Shopify. Simply copy and paste my code to replace the Shopify code already there.
```

## How to use these custom sections

Access the new sections using your theme editor, located in your `Customizer` in Shopify. Simply add a new section like you would normally add any other section in Shopify.

And you're good to go!

## Final note

I tested these new liquid sections using the free `Dawn` theme in Shopify. I'm not sure if they are compatible with any other free Shopify theme. 

You can always test it out to find out.
